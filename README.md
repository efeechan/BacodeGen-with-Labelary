# ZPL to PDF/PNG Converter
This project converts Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) files to either PDF or PNG format. It consists of two Python scripts and a PowerShell script for sequential execution.

# Usage
1-Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.

2-Place your ZPL files in the "input" directory.

3-Run the PowerShell script execute_python_files.ps1 using PowerShell.

4-The first Python script (excel_test.py) reads data from the Excel file and modifies the ZPL content based on it. The modified ZPL files will be saved in the "input" directory.

5-The second Python script (barcodegui.pyw) provides a GUI to specify the input and output directories, output format, page length, and width. It generates PDF or PNG files based on your selections.

Note: Adjust file paths in the PowerShell script if needed.

For any issues or questions, feel free to contact me. Happy ZPL conversion! ðŸ˜Š
